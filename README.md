# Ben Snitkoff's Bio 193 Research Project Git Repo

### Tufts Univeristy
### Fall 2023
### Dr. Benjamin Wolfe, advisor

This is a repository of selected data, figures, tables, and custom scripts used in my Bio 193 project for the fall of 2023. 

*Alignment Statistics.txt* is a text file containing the narrative output from bowtie2 runs on each of the datasets intially seected for this experiment.

*convert.py* is a short custom python script to convert a text file of nucleotide sequences with a single, aligned ORF into a fasta compliant document of amino acid sequences of the sequences.

*sampipe* is a commandline zsh script to run several steps of samtools on a given file while saving intermediate files, all with a single command 

Alignment Statistics was generated with bowtie2 based on my commands described in the Methods Section

convert.py was written entirely by myself

sampipe was written with the assistance of some helpful anonymous people on the internet to help me navigate some of the intracices of zsh scripting
